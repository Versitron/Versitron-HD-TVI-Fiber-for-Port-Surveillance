## HD-TVI Fiber for Port Surveillance

**Secure and long-range video transmission for port, dock, and harbor monitoring.**

- Transmits HD-TVI surveillance video over fiber for harsh marine or port environments  
- Provides long-distance, low-loss video links — ideal for expansive port grounds and shore-to-dock coverage  
- Resistant to electromagnetic interference and environmental noise common near industrial or marine settings  
- Supports fixed, PTZ, and night-vision cameras for comprehensive port security  

Perfect for port authorities, cargo terminals, harbor security, and coastal infrastructure monitoring.

## 4-Channel HD-TVI Kit

**Efficient multi-camera fiber kit for small-to-mid scale surveillance networks.**

- Supports up to **4 cameras** over a single fiber link — ideal for parking lots, small complexes, offices, or facility hubs  
- Balanced, scalable solution that reduces cabling complexity while delivering high-quality video  
- Compatible with standard HD-TVI cameras and fiber configurations  
- Provides consistent, interference-free video transmission across connected cameras  

Ideal for commercial facilities, logistics depots, small campus installations, or medium-sized outdoor areas.

## HD-TVI Fiber Kit Troubleshooting

**Guidelines and support for reliable deployment and maintenance of fiber-based HD-TVI systems.**

- Ensure fiber connectors are clean and properly seated; dust or misalignment can degrade video quality  
- Verify correct singlemode or multimode fiber type per link distance and camera requirements  
- Use shielded, grounded power for cameras/convertors to avoid noise coupling — though fiber itself remains EMI-immune  
- Confirm camera, converter, and DVR settings (resolution, frame rate, signal format) match HD-TVI standards to avoid format mismatch  
- Periodic inspection and cleaning of fiber connectors and proper environmental sealing help maintain long-term reliability  

Essential for installers, maintenance crews, and security teams deploying fiber-based video systems.

## EMI-Free HD-TVI Video Over Fiber Optic Cable

**High-integrity, interference-resistant video transmission for sensitive or noisy environments.**

- Fiber optic transmission is naturally immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio-frequency interference (RFI) — ideal near industrial, electrical, or marine installations  
- Prevents ground-loop issues and surge-related signal disruption common with copper-based cabling  
- Maintains stable video quality over long routes — suitable for large-scale security networks, infrastructure sites, or distributed installations  
- Enables clean, uninterrupted HD video streaming for surveillance, monitoring, and security systems  

Recommended for industrial zones, critical infrastructure, maritime facilities, utilities, and urban surveillance setups.
